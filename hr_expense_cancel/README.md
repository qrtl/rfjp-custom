Expense Cancellation
========================

This module lets you cancel the expense even after an journal entry has been generated for it.

The module was originally developed by Ecosoft and OSCG has made a minor adjustment to enable cancellation from 'Paid' status.  This is sort of a quick workaround to the situation where expense status stays as 'Paid' even when payment has been unreconciled, in which case, expense cancellation should be allowed.  In case an payment exists for the expense, cancellation is prevented based on the program logic.

Installation
============

No installation steps required other than installing the module itself.

Configuration
=============

No configuration is required.

Usage

Find the 'Cancel' button in the expense screen (Human Resources > Expenses > Expenses) when status is 'Draft', 'Done' or 'Paid'.
